# DoS Simulator

## Project Description
DoS Simulator is a tool designed to simulate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for educational and testing purposes. It allows users to understand how DoS attacks work and evaluate the resilience of their systems against such attacks. This project provides a controlled environment to study network security vulnerabilities safely.

## Features
- Simulates various types of DoS attacks.
- Customizable attack parameters such as target IP, port, and duration.
- Supports multi-threaded attack execution for realistic simulation.
- Provides detailed logs and reports for analysis.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Network access to the target system (for testing purposes only)

## Usage
To run the DoS Simulator, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python dos_simulator.py --target <IP_ADDRESS> --port <PORT> --duration <SECONDS>
```

Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>`, `<PORT>`, and `<SECONDS>` with your target's IP address, the port number to attack, and the duration of the attack in seconds, respectively.

## Example
```bash
python dos_simulator.py --target 192.168.1.10 --port 80 --duration 60
```
This command will simulate a DoS attack on the target IP `192.168.1.10` at port `80` for `60` seconds.

## Warnings and Ethical Use
- This tool is intended for educational and authorized testing purposes only.
- Do not use DoS Simulator to attack systems without explicit permission.
- Unauthorized use of this tool may be illegal and punishable by law.
- Always ensure you have proper authorization before running any tests.

## Advanced Usage
For advanced users, DoS Simulator supports additional options such as:
- Specifying the number of threads for concurrent attack simulation.
- Customizing packet types and payloads.
- Logging attack statistics to a file.

Use the `--help` flag to see all available options:

```bash
python dos_simulator.py --help
```

## Developer Info
This project is developed and maintained by a dedicated team of network security enthusiasts. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the tool and enhance its capabilities.
