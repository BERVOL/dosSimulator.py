# DoS Simulator

## Project Description
DoS Simulator is a tool designed to simulate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for educational and testing purposes. It allows users to understand how DoS attacks work and evaluate the resilience of their systems against such attacks. This project provides a controlled environment to study network security vulnerabilities safely.

## Features
- Simulates HTTP-based DoS attacks.
- Interactive input for attack parameters such as target URL, number of requests, and duration.
- Supports asynchronous attack execution for realistic simulation.
- Provides live attack statistics and detailed logs for analysis.
- Generates comprehensive reports.
- Easy-to-use interactive interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Network access to the target system (for testing purposes only)

## Usage
Run the DoS Simulator script, and you will be prompted to enter the target URL, number of requests, and attack duration interactively.

Example:
```
Enter the target URL: http://example.com
Enter the number of requests per second: 100
Enter the duration of the attack in seconds: 60
```

This will simulate an HTTP DoS attack on the specified target for the given duration.

## Warnings and Ethical Use
- This tool is intended for educational and authorized testing purposes only.
- Do not use DoS Simulator to attack systems without explicit permission.
- Unauthorized use of this tool may be illegal and punishable by law.
- Always ensure you have proper authorization before running any tests.

## Developer Info
This project is developed and maintained by a dedicated team of network security enthusiasts. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the tool and enhance its capabilities.
