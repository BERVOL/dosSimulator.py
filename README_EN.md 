# 💣 DoS Attack Simulator (Python)

This is a terminal-based **DoS (Denial of Service)** attack simulator built with Python.  
Its purpose is to send a large number of requests to a target URL and observe the server’s response under heavy load.

> 🔒 This project is intended **for educational and testing purposes only**. Unauthorized attacks on live systems are illegal and prohibited.

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔹 Start Test Server

First, launch the test server:

```bash
python3 test_server.py
```

Then open this in your browser:  
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 🔹 Run the DoS Simulator

In another terminal:

```bash
python3 dos_simulator.py
```

You’ll be asked:

```
🎯 Enter target URL (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000):
📨 Enter number of requests:
🔁 Enter thread count:
```

Then the attack begins! 🚀
